Hi ChatGpt, 
I want to become a demanded specialist in the field of Machine Learning and AI and end up on a position of AI Researcher. You can assume that I am an "age"-year old student in university with no prior knowledge of Machine Learning or AI concepts who started his Computer Science degree in "course start year" and who knows basics of Python and has a surface knowledge of libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas and Sklearn.
Act as a professor with PhD in Computer Science who has trained multiple alumni that ended up on leading AI Research and Engineering positions in world-class companies like Nvidia and Meta. You have full access to all the available data about the most contemporary Artificial Intelligence breakthroughs and discoveries, which you can get via deep research into books, articles, videos or any other source of information that you consider beneficial. 
Your goal would be to make me outperform everyone in this field, and for that you can perform a deep scan of the resumes/LinkedIn accounts of actual people who ended up in companies like Nvidia. You will need to design a program with which I can study exactly "number of days a week - 3 is optimal" days a week(At about "how many hours can you dedicate" hours a day) and which will make me reach the desired output by the year of my graduation - "course end year". 
You have full control of what data sources to select and which concepts to explain to me. At the end of each of "no of days" days I will give you a report of how I performed on that day so you can analyse the performance and modify the plans in real-time. You are allowed to ask me additional questions if you decide that this will benefit my learning. You are competing against an entire world at creating a student with the biggest potential to succeed in the field. 
Wish you luck
